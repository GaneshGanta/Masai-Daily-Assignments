1Q) What is MVC architecture in Java?

*The model designs based on the MVC architecture follow MVC design pattern. The application logic is separated from the user 
 interface while designing the software using model designs.

*The MVC pattern architecture consists of three layers :
 
a) Model: It represents the business layer of an application. It is an object to carry the data that can also contain 
          the logic to update the controller if data is changed.

b)View: It represents the presentation layer of an application. It is used to visualize the data that the model contains.

c)Controller: It works on both the model and view. It is used to manage the flow of applications, i.e. data flow in the 
              model object and update the view whenever data is changed.



*In Java Programming, the Model contains the simple Java classes, the View used to display the data and the Controller contains the servlets. 
 Due to this separation, the user requests are processed as follows:

MVC Architecture in Java:
======================== 

*A client (browser) sends a request to the controller on the server side, for a page.

*The controller then calls the model. It gathers the requested data.

*Then the controller transfers the data retrieved to the view layer.

*Now the result is sent back to the browser (client) by the view.

Q2- What is the HTTP protocol, explain about the HTTP request and the HTTP response.


*HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. This is a basis for data communication in the internet. The data communication 
  starts with a request sent from a client and ends with the response received from a web server.

*A website URL starting with “http://” is entered in a web browser from a computer (client). The browser can be a Chrome, Firefox, 
 Edge, Safari, Opera or anything else.

*Browser sends a request sent to the web server that hosts the website.

*The web server then returns a response as a HTML page or any other document format to the browser.

*Browser displays the response from the server to the user.



***HTTP Request :
   ============


A simple request message from a client computer consists of the following components:

*A request line to get a required resource, for example, a request GET /content/page1.html is requesting a resource 
 called /content/page1.html from the server.

*Headers (Example – Accept-Language: EN).

*An empty line.

*A message body that is optional.




***HTTP Response :
   =============

A simple response from the server contains the following components:

*HTTP Status Code (For example HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently, means the requested resource was permanently 
 moved and redirected to some other resource).

*Headers (Example – Content-Type: html)

*An empty line.

*A message body which is optional.

All the lines in the server response should end with a carriage return and line feed. Similar to the request, the empty 
line in a response also should only have carriage return and line feed without any spaces.

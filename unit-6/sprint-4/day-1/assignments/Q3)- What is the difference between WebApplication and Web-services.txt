Q3- What is the difference between WebApplication and Web-services

Web Application :
***************

A Web application, or Web app, is a Web site that allows users to access and interact with software from any computer or device 
that is connected to the Internet. Users often interact with Web applications directly at the Web site, referred to as the host,
through their Web browser. Some Web sites, however, require you to download the software to your local computer or device. Web 
application hosts often store users’ data and information on their servers. Some Web applications provide users with an option 
of storing data locally on their own personal computer or mobile device.



Web Services :
************
Web services describe standardized software that enables programmers to create applications that communicate with other remote 
computers over the Internet or over an internal business network. Businesses are the primary users of Web services because this 
technology provides a means for departments to communicate with each other, suppliers, vendors, and with clients. For example, 
third-party vendors can use Web services to communicate with their online retailer’s Web site to manage their inventory levels.

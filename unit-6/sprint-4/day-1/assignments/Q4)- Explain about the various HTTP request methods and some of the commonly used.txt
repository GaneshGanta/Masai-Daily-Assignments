Q4- Explain the various HTTP request methods and some of the commonly used HTTP response status codes.


HTTP request methods:
====================

a) GET: The requested resource has been transmitted in the response together with the message body.

b) HEAD: The representation headers are transmitted in the response without any message body.

c) POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the response.

d) TRACE: The response contains the request message as received by the server.



HTTP response status codes:
**************************

a)201 Created

This status code indicates that the request has succeeded and has resulted in the creation of a new resource. 
The server will have to create the resource before returning the 201. The new resource is returned in the body of the message, 
and it can be located either at the URI of the request, or at the content of the Location header.

b)202 Accepted

This status code indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, and the processing has not been completed or started. 
The request may or may not be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.

c)404 Not Found

This status code indicates that the server can’t find anything matching the Request-URI. Links that lead to a 404 page are often 
called broken or dead links and can be subject to link rot.

d)408 Request Timeout

This status code indicates that the server would like to shut down this unused connection because the request exceeded the time 
that the server was prepared to wait.


e)500 Internal Server Error

This status code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. 
This error response is usually used as a generic “catch-all” response indicating that the server cannot find a better 5xx status code to respond.


f)502 Bad Gateway

This status code indicates that the server while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server in 
attempting to fulfill the request. A 502 code is not something you can fix but requires a fix by the web server or the proxies you are 
trying to get access through.

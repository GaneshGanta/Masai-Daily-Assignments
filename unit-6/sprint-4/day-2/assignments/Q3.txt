3Q)Explain the difference between SOAP and REST.

1)The SOAP essentially uses WSDL more specifically XML specification for its definition and function.
  On the other hand, REST can support formats, such as JSON, XML, etc.

2)SOAP provides a standard and is considered a protocol while REST does not build new standards and 
  uses existing standards as REST is just an architectural style.


3)The size of the messages in REST is smaller and it also consumes less bandwidth because it just needs a 
  JSON body with an HTTP connection for writing the request to the client, unlike SOAP. As against, 
  SOAP contains large-size messages which take a lot of bandwidth.


4)SOAP client and server are tightly coupled where any feature extension and alteration may not be possible or difficult. 
  Conversely, in REST the client and server have a loose coupling and can easily adapt to change.

Q4/-Explain about the ORM, what are the benefits of the ORM approach over the JDBC approach.


A: Object Relational Mapping provides an abstraction on JDBC by allowing directly java objects to store with the relational table.
   
   In simple, mapping of the java object with a database table is called Object-Relational-Mapping.Each row is considered as 
   
   a Java Object and fields of the java object are defined as columns in the table.If any update occurs in the Java object
   
   it will reflect in the Database as well and vice versa.


Advantages of the ORM approach over the JDBC approach :

a)we can directly store the state of an object of a java class with the database software.

b)Boilerplate code issues for developers are resolved or simplified.

c)It will not throw checked exceptions so no need to handle them.

d)ORM based persistence logic is platform Independent, unlike JDBC.

e)It will generate fine-tuned queries internally.

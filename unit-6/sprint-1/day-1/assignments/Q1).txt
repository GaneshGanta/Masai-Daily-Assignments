Q1/ Explain the Build process of the Java Application, How the Maven helps in the application build?



***Build Process in java based project/application management:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

develpers duty/responsibility to develop a java based business application:

1. write some source code(bunch of classes, inteface...) 

2.add some external  jarfiles to the classpath (dependencies of our application)
in JDBC dao project, driver jar file is the dependency of our project.

3.compile the code.

4.prepare some test cases. (Unit test, Junit, Mockito, Sonar ) 

5.add Junit/mockito related jar files inside the classpath

6.compile  and run the test cases.

7.arrange our code in a standard folder structure

Java based Webapplication:
----------------------------------

*.java
*.class
*.jar
*.html
*.css
*.js
*.xml files
*.mp3, mp4, jpg, gif 

8.Do the packaging by building the jar, war file. 

9.deploy this jar file/ war file to the server.


***How the Maven helps in the application build :


1. Maven has the capabilities of donwloading the required jar files from internet automatically.

2. It can prepare,compile and run the test cases automatically.

3. With the help of pom.xml file adding the dependencies become easier with Maven tool.

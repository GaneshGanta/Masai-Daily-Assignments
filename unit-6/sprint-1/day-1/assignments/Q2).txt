Q2/- What is the POM, Explain the basic properties of the pom.xml file in Maven based application.


*A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. 

*It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.
 
*It contains default values for most projects. Examples of this is the build directory, which is the "target", the source directory, 
 which is src/main/java; the test source directory, which is src/test/java; and so on. 

*When executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory. 

*It reads the POM, gets the needed configuration information, then executes the goal.

2. compile: maven compiles all the source code of the project by downloading and adding requied jar files in the classpath.

3. test-compile: if we have written any unit test cases that code will be compiled.

4. Test: maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are successful and how many fails.

5. Package: maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside the 'target' folder.

6. installing: the jar file in step 5 will be stored in the local repo.

7. deploy maven stores the application jar file to the central repo.

8. clean: here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in the previous build. this phase is an isolated phase.
